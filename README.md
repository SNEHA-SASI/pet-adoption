### Project Description
    The Pet Adoption System is a web-based platform that allows users to browse available pets and submit adoption requests. It includes a login and registration system, an admin panel for managing pets and adoption requests, and a secure database to store user and pet information. Admins can approve or reject adoption requests, updating the pet's availability in real time.

### The Problem statement
